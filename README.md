# PolyGridWizZ (Polynomial Gridgeneration Wizard) - ParamAIR (Parametric Airfoils)
Crafting structured multiblock high-fidelity grids around parametric airfoils with blunt and sharp trailing edges. Airfoil geometry characteristics such as thickness and curvature are defined by 6 independent parameters.

We are more than happy about feedback and contributions. For any questions and enquiries, do not hesitate to contact Markus Zauner (m.zauner@soton.ac.uk).

# PolyGridWizZ_v0.0.1-beta
